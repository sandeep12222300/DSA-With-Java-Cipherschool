1.Method Overriding
     Method overriding is one of the ways by which Java achieves Run Time Polymorphism. The version of a method that is executed will be determined by the object that is used to invoke it. If an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method, then the version in the parent class will be executed, but if an object of the subclass is used to invoke the method, then the version in the child class will be executed. In other words, it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable) that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.
